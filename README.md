# Mi-Mercadito-App
Hello this is #Daniel Lepe Vega# a sixth semester mexican student in Computational Systems Engineer at Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara. And I would like to build an app for the people and fix the big problem that we are all facing right now because of COVID-19.
If you want to know more about the project, please visit @DanielLepeVega on Facebook or @daniel.lepev on Instagram, so we can talk more about how your abilities can be helpful to this project. 

# Mi-Mercadito-App is a free open source web based application
This is the beggining of the app, this is where I will be working designs to help build a Full Stack Application, that helps business people connect in a better way with their customers. 

The point of this is aplication is for the community to grow and have a direct relation with the software part of the process, so that it can be used and improved to create a market for sellers and buyers in Guadalajara.

This will also work as a log file.
I will be posting the version of the app here as well as the updated link of the application online, so that you can go check it out, test it and then improve it with another idea.
